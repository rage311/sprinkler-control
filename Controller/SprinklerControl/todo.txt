1.  Demand run all zones for configured amounts of time
2.  Consistency between config file var names and "status" output names/formats
3.  Fix/complete code to configure via network
4.  Add controller's current time to status output
5.  Add "countdown to next scheduled run" to status output
6.  Allow demand runs even if NTP server can't be reached (and therefore current time is unknown)
    - Add some kind of status message and maybe blink on-board LED when NTP server can't be reached
7.  Make time zone configurable via config file
8.  Auto zone run time ramping based on time of year (bell curve from April to October?)
    - Eventually use moisture sensors for this purpose
